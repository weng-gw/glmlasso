* Introduction
This is an R package for implementing L1-penalized logistic using the iterative coordinate descent algorithm.

Compared with the R package =glmnet= which uses [Fortran](https://fortran-lang.org/) to implement most of the fundamental computation logic, we use C to implement most of the logic and R serves as a "glue" language to call those C methods.

For performance comparison with =glmnet=, please refer to my [[file:glmlasso_slide.pdf][slides]].
